-- v184 -- awake over-call in detect_sleep_window
--
-- 2026-09-16. Replayed 20 nights against the stored rollup (replica matched to +-4 min):
-- the stager averaged 108 min 'awake' per night; Whoop's own algorithm over 451 of the
-- same user's nights averaged 50. Two mechanisms, both in the awake rule:
--   1. hi_frac was a 5-min majority of an already 5-min-smoothed HR. One 2-minute
--      roll-over became 5-7 minutes of 'awake'.
--   2. floor+9 with no motion input called calm, elevated, steady-breathing stretches
--      awake (e.g. 02:29-02:44 on 09-16: HR 67, sd 1.4, RMSSD 28, RR 16.5).
-- Fix: flag on the raw minute; soft-awake needs within-minute HR jitter (sd>=3) in 2 of 5
-- minutes, or floor+14. Replay: 108 -> 75 min avg; last night 93 -> 48 (7.0h -> 7.8h).
-- Known limit: quiet wake lying still is now scored as sleep. That is the HR-only trade;
-- Whoop makes the same one without the accelerometer.
-- Rollback: re-apply v183's detect_sleep_window (this file's only change is that function).
